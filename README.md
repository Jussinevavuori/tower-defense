# Tower Defense
## Created by Jussi Nevavuori 2019

Tower Defense is a game project created for an university coding course at Aalto University in 2019.
This project got me a solid 5 / 5 from the course!
Created using Scala and the ScalaFX and scala.xml libraries.

#### Features
* Fully functional, simple and intutitive gameplay-mechanics

* Different 'towers', with different projectiles (bullets, boomerangs, missiles)
* Different enemies, which get stronger over time and break up into weaker enemies
* All towers are upgradeable
* Animal creatrues
* Sweet retro-inspired, DIY graphics and 8-bit musics and SFX

###### Note:
> Tower Defense is entirely created in Scala and does not work outside of the Eclipse IDE as exporting Scala
> projects must apparently be done with SBT which I couldn't be bothered to learn. Exporting the code to work
> outside of Eclipse IDE was not included in the scope of the course.
