DELETING MAPS
	
NEW GAME (?)

	New game menu displayes several different default
	maps from which the player can choose.
	
DIFFICULTY LEVELS (?)

	Three difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard.
	Difficulty could have an effect on waves and health
	and money.
	
GRAPHICS (?)

	Each level could also have graphics assigned to it.
	Players could in the create level menu drag and drop
	custom graphics, like trees that would be saved and
	rendered by the game.
	
ALTERNATE GRAPHICS (?)

	There could be 1-3 different alternate graphics (grassy
	summer, orange fall, white winter for example) that would
	correspond to the different default maps. In a custom made
	level the player could choose which skin to use in the map.
