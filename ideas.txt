SAVING AND LOADING FILES

	Instead of having separate files for each map
	create a single xml file that contains every
	map. Each map should have a tag for whether
	they're custom made or not. Only show custom
	made maps in map loader.
	
	Must customize GameLoader and GameSaver to
	work with new system.
	
						# XML mockup
	<maps>
		<map custom=0>	# default map
			<data/>
		<map/>
		
		<map custom=1>	# custom map
			<data/>
		<map/>
	<maps/>
	
	
	Deleting maps should also be allowed.
	
	
LOAD GAME

	Load game menu displays a scrolling list of maps
	that have been created (only showing custom maps.)

NEW GAME

	New game menu displayes several different default
	maps from which the player can choose.
	
DIFFICULTY LEVELS

	Three difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard.
	Difficulty could have an effect on waves and health
	and money.
	
GRAPHICS

	Each level could also have graphics assigned to it.
	Players could in the create level menu drag and drop
	custom graphics, like trees that would be saved and
	rendered by the game.
	
ALTERNATE GRAPHICS

	There could be 1-3 different alternate graphics (grassy
	summer, orange fall, white winter for example) that would
	correspond to the different default maps. In a custom made
	level the player could choose which skin to use in the map.
